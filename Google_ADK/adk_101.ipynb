    "\n",
    "✅ Tool Definition & Usage: Crafting Python functions (tools) that grant agents specific abilities (like fetching data) and instructing agents on how to use them effectively. </br>\n",
    "✅ Multi-LLM Flexibility: Configuring agents to utilize various leading LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) via LiteLLM integration, allowing you to choose the best model for each task. </br>\n",
    "✅ Agent Delegation & Collaboration: Designing specialized sub-agents and enabling automatic routing (auto flow) of user requests to the most appropriate agent within a team.</br>\n",
    "✅ Session State for Memory: Utilizing Session State and ToolContext to enable agents to remember information across conversational turns, leading to more contextual interactions. </br>\n",
