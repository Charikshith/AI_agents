# üÜö Responses API vs. Agents SDK ‚Äì A Comparative Analysis

## üîç Overview
This document provides a detailed comparison between **OpenAI's Responses API** (Chat Completions) and the **Agents SDK** (for autonomous AI agents).  

The key distinction:  
- **Responses API** uses the **LLM as an assistant** (text generator).  
- **Agents SDK** uses the **LLM as an agent** (autonomous decision-maker).

## üìä Comparative Analysis Table

| Feature            | **Responses API** (Chat Completions) | **Agents SDK** (Task Automation) |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **LLM Role**       | **LLM as an assistant** (generates direct responses) | **LLM as an agent** (autonomous decision-maker) |
| **Purpose**        | Generate AI-powered responses in a structured chat format | Automate multi-step workflows with tool integration |
| **Best for**       | Chatbots, conversational AI, Q&A systems | Autonomous AI agents performing complex tasks |
| **Interaction Type** | **Single-turn** or **multi-turn chat** | **Multi-step decision-making** and reasoning |
| **Tool Integration** | Can call external functions using OpenAI‚Äôs function calling | Supports tools, retrieval, and code execution out of the box |
| **Memory**         | Stateless (memory needs to be managed manually) | Built-in memory for handling ongoing tasks |
| **Streaming**      | Supports streaming responses | Supports streaming execution logs and results |
| **Complexity**     | Simple API calls, easy to use | Requires defining tools and workflows |
| **Use Case Examples** | - AI chatbots (customer support, personal assistants) <br> - Summarization <br> - Code generation <br> - Knowledge-based Q&A | - AI research assistants <br> - Automated coding & debugging <br> - Data analysis <br> - Complex decision-making workflows |

## üöÄ When to Use Each?

### ‚úÖ **Use Responses API when:**
- You need **simple chat-based interactions**.
- Your system doesn‚Äôt require **memory or persistent context**.
- You need **real-time streaming responses**.
- You want to implement **function calling** for limited tool use.

**Example Use Cases:**  
‚úî AI-powered chatbots (customer support, personal assistants)  
‚úî Generative AI for text completion (writing, summarization)  
‚úî Code generation (LLM-assisted coding)  
‚úî Question-answering systems  

---

### ü§ñ **Use Agents SDK when:**
- Your AI agent needs **autonomy** and multi-step reasoning.
- You require **persistent memory** and context awareness.
- You want to **automate workflows** with built-in tools.
- Your use case involves **retrieval, code execution, or API calls**.

**Example Use Cases:**  
‚úî Research agents that retrieve and summarize data  
‚úî AI-powered coding assistants (debugging, fixing, writing)  
‚úî Automated customer workflows (AI-powered CRM)  
‚úî Multi-step AI agents performing real-world tasks  

---

## üßê Simple Takeaway:
‚úÖ **Responses API = LLM as an assistant** (text generator, chatbot-style interactions)  
‚úÖ **Agents SDK = LLM as an agent** (autonomous, decision-making, tool-using AI)

## What we will cover

1. Introduction
2. Text prompting
3. Conversation states
4. Function calling
5. Structured output
6. Web search
7. Reasoning
8. File search

## Most important things to know

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The Responses API is a superset of Chat Completions - everything you can do with Chat Completions can be done with Responses API, plus additional features.

2. **Migration Timeline**: The Chat Completions API is not being deprecated and will continue to be supported indefinitely as an industry standard for building AI applications, while the Assistants API (not Chat Completions) is the one planned for eventual deprecation in 2026.


3. **Key New Features**:
   - Simplified interface for different interaction types
   - Native support for web search capabilities
   - A new `developer` role you can use
   - Improved support for reasoning models
   - Built-in file/vector search functionality
   - Simplified conversation state management

4. **Available Tools**:
   - **Web search**: Include data from the Internet in model response generation
   - **File search**: Search the contents of uploaded files for context when generating a response
   - **Computer use**: Create agentic workflows that enable a model to control a computer interface
   - **Function calling**: Enable the model to call custom code that you define, giving it access to additional data and capabilities

5. **When to Migrate**:
   - For new applications: Start with Responses API to be future-proof
   - For existing applications: Begin planning migration, but no immediate urgency
   - Test the new API in parallel with existing implementations

6. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - API structure changes but core AI engineering principles remain the same
   - Features that previously required multiple API calls can now be done in single calls
   - The fundamental patterns of retrieval, tools, and memory management still apply

7. **New Agent SDK**: OpenAI has released a new Agent SDK that will replace [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main). This provides a standardized way to build AI agents with the Responses API. Learn more at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents
